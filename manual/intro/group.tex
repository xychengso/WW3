\vssub

The development of \ww  relies on the efforts of a team of developers that have worked tirelessly to make this an effective community tool. With the expansion of physical and numerical parameterizations available, the list of contributors to this model keeps growing. The development group consists of a core group of developers that are involved in overall code development, debugging and optimization as well as a larger group that has either made or continues to make contributions to physics packages and numerics. The following is a list of contributors (both past and present) of this development group (in alphabetic order):

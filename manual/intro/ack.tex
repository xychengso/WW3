The \ws\ wind wave model started by Hendrik Tolman with the development of the WAVEWATCH model at Delft University and WAVEWATCH II at NASA, Goddard Space Flight Center in the early 1990s.  
The development of \ws\ has transitioned from being a task undertaken by a single person or group to a community modeling framework. We are thankful to all our partners in the scientific community who have undertaken the development of this modeling system as part of their research activities. We are also extremely grateful to the larger user community who have tirelessly worked with us to identify bugs and other issues in the model.
